What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	I get a repository with no commits because nothing changed in the files after I created the repository , I need it to keep track of the changes I've made in form of commits to refer to it later.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	the staging area is the intermediate between the repository and the working directory to specify which will be commited, this will help really good to rule out the files/dir which won't be changed for a while.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
