When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when I need to make it an open source project that others can work in collaborations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    to prevent conflicts and the buggy versions to be released on a master branch without verfication first

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: for copying others' work to make version of my own while giving credits to the original version.
    clones: getting copy on local machine from remote repository.
    branches: making versions without affecting the production version.

stored locally?

    it would help when conflicts occur to fix it on the final commit
